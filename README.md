# Investment Market Exploration and Investors Clustering 

This is the repository for Columbia Data Science Capstone Project sponsered by Vanguard.

## Goal

To understand how investment companies are clustered and behave based on their shared holdings. 
* Part I: To transform the huge holdings data with billions of records into easily digestible insights through metrics constructions and dashboard visualizations. 
* Part II: To identify cohorts of similar investors through clustering analysis.
* Part III: To detect the polarized topics for investment over the past 10 years
* Part IV: To develop a dashboard for visualization of the project results.
